ML/Software Engineer @ New Odyssey

Find all my projects ***not*** here because GitHub has decided to be evil.

Use my [Don't Be Evil License 1.0](https://aethrvmn.gr/license).

I use [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/aethrvmn), and [my own server](https://git.apotheke.earth).

[SourceHut](https://sr.ht) is also a good alternative to GitHub, but you have to get used to sending emails.

I like [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) as a programming language, I think it has a bright future.

I support digital self-sovereignty.
