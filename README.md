# Vasilis Valatsos (Βασίλης Βαλατσός)

ML/Software Engineer @ New Odyssey

<h1> Find all my projects ***not*** here because I disagree with GitHub. <br/> Instead I use [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/aethrvmn), and [my own git server](https://erga.apotheke.earth). </h1>

[SourceHut](https://sr.ht) is also a good alternative to GitHub, but you have to get used to sending emails.

I mostly use my own custom [Don't Be Evil License 1.1](https://apotheke.earth/license). It's a [SourceFirst](sourcefirst.org) license.

I currently mostly use Python, but I really like [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) as a programming language, I think it has a bright future.

I support digital self-sovereignty.
